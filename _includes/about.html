                    <b>TORACLE 2022</b> is the 2nd International Workshop on Test Oracles.
       <br/>
             <br/>          
                    The challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect test executions is called the <b>(test) oracle problem</b> and it is recognised as one of the fundamental challenges in software testing. For the first time TORACLE 2021 will bring together researchers and practitioners working on the techniques, approaches and tools related to the alleviation and automation of the oracle problem. The workshop will enable the participants to present ideas, discuss recent results and develop a shared agenda for future research.
